/*
 * WatchThis is a program to help the user choose what to watch.
 * The idea is that the user would feed in information about various series and
 * be able to give certain parameters to WatchTHis and then WatchThis would return
 * an episode that fit the parameters. 
 * Example parameters would be length, for when you only have 15 minutes to watch something,
 * or genre, for the moments when you just want to laugh.
 * I also want the ability to have the user be able to go to the next episode of a series if
 * they decide they would like to continue watching what they were.
