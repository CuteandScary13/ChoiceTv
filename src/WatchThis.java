 * To Whom it may concern:
 * This beginnings of a personal project is made to show competence in Java.
 * I would have preferred to have shown something much more fleshed out and 
 * a better representative of my Java knowledge, but my laptop recently broke
 * and I didn't use gitHub to store any of my other projects (a lesson I surely
 * won't forget any time soon). I only saw your posting recently, and this is 
 * all I have been able to make in a roughly 24 hour period, while balancing

 * WatchThis is a program to help the user choose what to watch.
 * The idea is that the user would feed in information about various series and
 * be able to give certain parameters to WatchTHis and then WatchThis would return
 * an episode that fit the parameters. 
 * Example parameters would be length, for when you only have 15 minutes to watch something,
 * or genre, for the moments when you just want to laugh.
 * I also want the ability to have the user be able to go to the next episode of a series if
 * they decide they would like to continue watching what they were.
